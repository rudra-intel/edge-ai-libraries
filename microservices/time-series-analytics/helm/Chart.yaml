description: Helm chart for deploying Time Series Analytics Microservice

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
#
# Before pushing helm charts to a chart repository:
# 1. Update this version to format: 2026.0.0-<date>-weekly-helm where <date> is in yyyymmdd format
# 2. Update the appVersion below with the same date
# 3. Update the date in values.yaml file under images.weekly_build_date: "<date>"
#
# Example: If the release date is February 2, 2026:
#   version: 2026.0.0-20260202-weekly-helm
#   values.yaml -> images.weekly_build_date: "20260202"
version: 2026.0.0-helm

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
#
# Before pushing helm charts to a chart repository:
# 1. Update this appVersion to match the chart version above (same date format)
# 2. Ensure this matches the version field above: 2026.0.0-<date>-weekly-helm
#
# Example: If the release date is February 2, 2026:
#   appVersion: "2026.0.0-20260202-weekly-helm"
appVersion: "2026.0.0-helm"
